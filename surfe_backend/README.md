Note on Next Action Probabilities
We calculate how often each action follows a given action (e.g. what users do after LOGIN).

⚠️ Note on Accuracy
If one user performs many actions (e.g. only LOGIN → LOGIN), they can dominate the results.

✅ Two Methods
Global (default): Counts all transitions equally. Shows total usage trends.

Per-user average: Each user has equal weight. Shows typical user behavior.

Use the method that fits your analysis goal.
